Alright, this might look a bit confusing, if it does, I'll do my best do explain it lol

 Each tail is made to be added "on top" of each other, basically, when they overlap the darker shade on the tail will turn into a slightly lighter shade, so there can still be a distinct lineout
 So, the tails need to be added in that sequence, otherwise they'll look off :')
